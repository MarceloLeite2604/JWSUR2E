# JWSUR2E
This container has the examples from "Java Web Services Up And Running 2nd Edition" book.

The following tools were used to develop it:
  * Java SE Development Kit version 1.8.0_45
  * Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers Version Mars Release (4.5.0);
  * Apache Tomcat Version 8.0.20;
  * Apache Axis2 1.6.3 build (28-06-2015);
  * Microsoft Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3;
  * Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (For the perl scripts and remote access tests of the services created).

##### Obs:
Some of the examples were slightly modified to correct some minor things (e. g. warning messages) and adapt it to our environment (Java 1.8 compatibility).
